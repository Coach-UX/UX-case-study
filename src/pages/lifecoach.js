          Your future is calling. Are ready to pick up? And with that subversive messaging, we kicked off Coachâ€™s first immersive pop-up experience. The interactive, open-to-the-public, pop-up melded established brand codes (NYC, nostalgia and Americana) with of-the-moment mysticism (tarot, sound baths and astrology). The result; an unexpected experiential that put a premium on user experience, production values and content opportunities over overt product marketing.

        Held in SoHo, New York in June 2018, the week-long, immersive pop-up invited guests to explore four interactive spaces designed around the themes of creativity and self-expression.

        Created in collaboration with set designer Simon Costin, the playfully surreal experience included a DIY graffiti room, tarot readings, fairground games, live performances and nightly DJs sets. The entire experience was conceived and executed as a way to surprise and delight guests.
